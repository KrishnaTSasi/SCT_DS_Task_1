Task-1:- India Population Analysis

📊 India Population Growth Analysis (1960–2022)

A data analysis and visualization project that explores India’s population growth from 1960 to 2022 using Python. The project features interactive plots and clean data processing, offering insights into population trends across decades.

 🔧 Features

* Extracts and cleans yearly population data from 1960 to 2022
* Converts raw data to usable numeric types
* Plots a bar chart to visualize year-wise population growth
* Plots a histogram with KDE to understand population distribution
* Uses seaborn and matplotlib for customized, high-quality visuals
* Adds axis labels, titles, and grid layout for clarity

 🛠️ How It Works

* Data is sliced and transposed to select years 1960–2022
* Index is reset and data types are converted to ensure consistency
* A bar plot is created to show annual population increase
* A histogram with KDE overlay is plotted to analyze distribution
* All visuals are neatly styled with color themes like `cornflowerblue` and `orchid`

 📈 Visualizations

1. **Bar Chart:** India’s population growth (1960–2022)
2. **Histogram + KDE:** Distribution of population values

 ✅ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (for data cleaning and manipulation)
* **Matplotlib** (for figure layout and styling)
* **Seaborn** (for bar chart and histogram)
